# Human-or-Robot-Facebook-Kaggle

## Topic
The goal of this project is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity. 

## Reason why choose this topic
It is predicted that online retail sales will reach $6.17 trillion by 2023*. The project focusses on identifying robotic/automated bidders for online auctions. The hope is that the machine learning model could be further improved and developed to not only help with websites like eBay, which rely on bidding for items, but for any online transaction that relies on bidding.
